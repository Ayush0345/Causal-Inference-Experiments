# Causal-Inference-Experiments
Using Methods from Scott Cunninghum's Causal Inference Mixtapes to perform Causality Experiments (Propensity Score Matching, Instrumental Variables, Regression Discontinuity, Difference-in-Differences, Synthetic Controls, etc.)

**PSM.ipynb:** Uses data on catholic school attendance and its causal effect on math scores for 12th-grade students. I used the logit model with catholic students as the treatment and calculated the propensity scores. In addition, I used the propensity scores to get the causal inference of the treatment on the subject using 2 methods namely, Inverse Propensity Weights and Nearest Neighbor Matching (restricted to 3 scores). In both methods, the inference was positive but close to zero denoting that the two variables have a less strict causality relationship. Therefore, the experiment requires an IV to estimate the unobserved variable that causes the relationship to be positive and significant. (The experiment has been inspired by Atlonji (2005)).
